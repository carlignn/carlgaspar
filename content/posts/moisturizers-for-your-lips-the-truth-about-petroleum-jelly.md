It is very usual for a person to have a chapped and dry lips. So we tend to look for something that can resolve that problem. ***Petroleum Jelly or a Lip Balm (specifically, Vaseline)*** - is one of the few things that would come to our mind. But mind you, there is a lot more into moisturizing. Let's see the three classes of moisturizers:

## Occlusive

Creates a barrier between the skin and the air, preventing the skin from losing moisture. Not inherently moisturising, occlusive ingredients like petroleum jelly repel moisture, sealing it in your skin when applied. Petroleum jelly is the most occlusive, mineral oil or silicone.

Petrolatum (Petroleum Jelly) work by preventing evaporation of water from the skin and are particularly effective when applied to already dampened skin. Occlusives are the most common type of moisturizers used in formulations.

## Humectant

Extracts water molecules from air and pulls them into the skin's surface. Common humectants include glycerin, aloe, honey and sodium hyaluronate.

Glycerol or glycerin, hydroxy acids, propylene glycol, and urea – second major class of moisturizers, which increase the water content of the skin by enhancing water absorption into the skin surface (from the air and from the dermis underneath).

## Emollient

Emollients help restore your skin's own water barrier which repels moisture like occlusives. Emollients include most oils and butters. Ceramides and cholesterol are emollient, also.

Essential fatty acids, which are found in various natural oils (coconut/ olive/ almond oil etc) – improve the appearance and texture of skin by filling in the spaces between the skin cells and thus contribute to increased softness and smoothness of the skin thus improving its overall appearance.

# TL;DR

So, in other words: **Humectants bring the moisture to your skin. Occlusives keep it there until removed, and emollients help repair skin so it can keep the moisture in without the presence of occlusives**. A good moisturiser contains all three of these types of ingredient. 

For practical purposes petroleum jelly is the best moisturiser. However the best moisturiser really is one you like using and suits you well. Just remember that ‘expensive’ does not equal ‘good moisturiser’!

**Note** that these are not pre-made moisturizers, but rather moisturizing ingredients.
