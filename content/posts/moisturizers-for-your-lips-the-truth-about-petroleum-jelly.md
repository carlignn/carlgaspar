It is very usual for a person to have a chapped and dry lips. So we tend to look for something that can resolve that problem. ***Petroleum Jelly or a Lip Balm (specifically, Vaseline)*** - is one of the few things that would come to our mind. But mind you, there is a lot more into moisturizing. Let's see the the three categories of moisturizer:

##### Occlusive

Creates a barrier between the skin and the air, preventing the skin from losing moisture.

##### Humectant

Extracts water molecules from air and pulls them into the skin's surface

##### Emollient

* Occlusive - Not inherently moisturising, occlusive ingredients like petroleum jelly repel moisture, sealing it in your skin when applied. Petroleum jelly is the most occlusive, mineral oil or silicone a bit less so.
* Emollient - Emollients help restore your skin's own water barrier which repels moisture like occlusives. Emollients include most oils and butters. Ceramides and cholesterol are emollient, also.
* Humectant - Attracts water, pulling it into your skin. Common humectants include glycerin, aloe, honey and sodium hyaluronate.

So, in other words: **Humectants bring the moisture to your skin. Occlusives keep it there until removed, and emollients help repair skin so it can keep the moisture in without the presence of occlusives**. A good moisturiser contains all three of these types of ingredient. Then if it has extra goodies like niacinamide (for reduction of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) and ceramides, that's a bonus.

My dermatologist kept pushing QV skincare products on me. More or less just mineral oil and water, nothing to help my skin fend for itself. No thanks. I use a mineral oil/emulsifier mix in the shower which washes off (a shower milk), then if my skin is dry I'll use a light lotion with ceramides if my skin is good and a thicker cream on problem areas. I tried using the thicker cream all over but it made me break out in a heat rash which was indistinguishable from the eczema, leading to a vicious cycle of eczema and itching.

1. Occlusives: Petrolatum and dimethicone- work by preventing evaporation of water from the skin and are particularly effective when applied to already dampened skin. Occlusives are the most common type of moisturizers used in formulations.
2. Humectants: glycerol or glycerin, hydroxy acids, propylene glycol, and urea – second major class of moisturizers, which increase the water content of the skin by enhancing water absorption into the skin surface (from the air and from the dermis underneath).
3. Emollients: essential fatty acids, which are found in various natural oils (coconut/ olive/ almond oil etc) – improve the appearance and texture of skin by filling in the spaces between the skin cells and thus contribute to increased softness and smoothness of the skin thus improving its overall appearance.
4. Rejuvenators: Collagen, keratin, and elastin- These are natural skin proteins intended to replenish essential proteins in this skin. However they do not penetrate into the skin and do not work as they are intended to. They only have a role similar to emollients and improve skin appearance by creating a film that aesthetically smoothens the skin and stretches out and fills in fine lines. They DO NOT rejuvenate the skin!

Note: Ceramides which are marketed in expensive branded creams probably only have an emollient effect and are no superior to occlusives.

For practical purposes petroleum jelly is the best moisturiser. However the best moisturiser really is one you like using and suits you well. Just remember that ‘expensive’ does not equal ‘good moisturiser’!

I've used this source before, when talking about petroleum jelly, but it's great and straightforward about different types of moisturizers. Source: Nolan, K. and Marmur, E. (2012), Moisturizers: Reality and the skin benefits. Dermatologic Therapy, 25: 229–233.

Quoted from the text:

There are four main classes of moisturizers: occlusives, humectants, emollients, and rejuvenators.

**Occlusives**

Occlusives work by forming a hydrophobic layer on the surface of the skin providing an exogenous barrier to water loss. Because they prevent evaporation from the skin, they can be particularly effective when applied to already dampened skin. Occlusives are the most common type of moisturizers used in formulations \[1].

Although occlusives are not the most appealing of ingredients to consumers, due in part to their greasy feel, petrolatum, the prototypic occlusive, it is actually the most effective moisturizer and reduces transepidermal water loss by 99% \[7]. Petrolatum is the most commonly used active agent in skin care products, after water \[1]. Occlusives are well tolerated among individuals and are often used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A recent study \[8] found that an over-the-counter (OTC) petroleum-based skin moisturizer (Aquaphor Healing Ointment, Beiersdorf, Wilton, CT) was as clinically effective in treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis as a more expensive ceramide containing prescription barrier cream. Petrolatum also can help restore the stratum corneum barrier by penetrating into its upper layers and initiating the production of intercellular lipids, including free sterols, sphingolipids, and free fatty acids \[9]. Petrolatum is also able to reduce the appearance of fine lines caused by dehydration. Although principally an occlusive, petrolatum can also act as an emollient (discussed in more detail later) and fills the spaces between desquamating corneocytes making the skin smooth and soft.

Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today because like petrolatum, it is also is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic \[10]. Dimethicone is among a family of silicones that comprise the basis of all oil-free moisturizers \[1]. However, petrolatum is superior to dimethicone in decreasing fine facial lines of dehydration or for healing skin \[9]. Dimethicone is permeable to water vapor and therefore if the skin barrier is compromised, dimethicone will not reduce transepidermal water loss. This however is beneficial in some foundations and sunscreens, in that it allows for the evaporation of perspiration, preventing the skin from feeling warm developing miliaria \[1]. Like petrolatum, dimethicone can also act as an emollient.

**Humectants**

This second major class of moisturizers are able to increase the water content of the skin by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis. Some also think that humectants are able to hydrate the stratum corneum by absorbing water from the external environment \[11]. In contrast to occlusives, humectants have several hydrophilic hydroxyl groups, and their hydroscopic properties allow them to attract and hold water molecules. Because of humectants’ ability to enhance water absorption upward from the dermis, these compounds can cause excessive water loss from the dermis through evaporation into the lower humidity environment. This occurs especially if the skin barrier is compromised. Because of this phenomenon, in formulations humectants are always combined with occlusives that prevent water loss. Humectants include hydroxy acids, propylene glycol, and urea.

The most common humectant used in moisturizers is glycerol or glycerin. This hydroscopic compound is the most effective humectant and can also activate transglutaminase activity in the stratum corneum, accelerating the maturation of corneocytes and reducing scaling in xerotic skin \[11]. Glycerin also has some unique characteristics including its ability to produce moisturizing effects in the skin long after it is no longer present. Glycerin is able to produce this effect through modulating water channels in the skin, known as aquaporins \[1]. The principal aquaporin in the epidermis is aquaporin-3. Interestingly, aquaporin-3 expression is increased in human skin diseases, with elevated transepidermal water loss \[1]. Overall, when combined with occlusive agents, glycerin has the ability to produce significant moisturizing effects in the skin.

**Emollients**

This class of moisturizer is used to improve the appearance and texture of skin by filling in the crevices between corneocytes. This contributes to increased softness and smoothness of the skin and improves its overall appearance. Some common emollients include essential fatty acids, which are found in various natural oils. These essential fatty acids like linoleic acid can be oxidized to eicosanoids, which are important signaling molecules involved in inflammatory pathways and the immune system. It is therefore thought that fatty acids may also influence skin physiology \[11].

**Rejuvenators**

This final class of moisturizers is intended to replenish essential proteins in this skin. Collagen, keratin, and elastin are skin proteins that are often found in rejuvenators. Because these proteins are relatively large, a considerable limitation to rejuvenators is their difficulty penetrating of the stratum corneum \[12]. Although rejuvenators may not be able to successfully replenish proteins in the dermis, they can have a role similar to emollients and improve skin appearance by creating a film that aesthetically smoothes the skin and stretches out and fills in fine lines.

**Ceramides**

Although not a class of moisturizer, these lipid molecules have been used increasingly in recent years in the treatment of atopic skin and in cosmeceuticals. Ceramides are an essential component of normal stratum corneum and function to help maintain the integrity of the skin barrier. In 1990, it was found that the level of ceramides was greatlyreduced in the stratum corneum in patients with atopic dermatis. It was subsequently concluded that an insufficiency of ceramides in the stratum corneum is an important factor in atopic dry skin \[5]. Subsequently, ceramides have been added to many moisturizes used in the treatment of both atopic and normal skin. Because ceramides are oil soluble, they can easily be incorporated into moisturizers; however, many products with ceramides, especially prescription formulations, can be prohibitively expensive \[6]. Although ceramides have been shown to improve barrier function of damaged skin \[3], recent studies have shown that inexpensive OTC nonceramide products can be just as effective in treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis \[3].

**EDIT** Note that these are not pre-made moisturizers, but rather moisturizing ingredients.
