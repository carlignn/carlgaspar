For many of us that works in Information Security, many of us sees risk as a negative thing. But risk is an essential part of a business. From **ISO/IEC 31000** - Risk is the effect of uncertainty on an objective. An effect is a deviation from the expected - positive and/negative.

## Risk Standards

* **ISO/IEC 31000** - Risk Management Principles and Guideline
* **ISO/IEC 27005** - Information Technology - Security Techniques - Information Security Risk Management
* **NIST SP800-39** - Managing Information Security Risk
* **COBIT 5 for Risk**
* **NIST SP800-30 Rev 1** - Guide for Conducting Risk Assessment
* **HTRA** - Harmonized Threat and Risk Assessment



## Risk Management begins with:

* Knowing what has to be protected

  * Identification of assets
  * Determining asset value
* Understanding risk culture of the organization

  * Risk acceptance
  * Risk tolerance



## Risk Relative to Information Security Management

**Information Security Risk** is a potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization.

* Obtain mandate and commitment from the management
* Design a risk management framework

  * Understand the organization

    * Unique requirements

## Elements of Risk Management

* Policy - What seems to be the most important to the organization
* Resources - People, budget
* Accountability - Who is the owner of the risk

**Risk management** works effectively when it is implemented based on a framework adapted to the needs of the organization and consistently applied.
