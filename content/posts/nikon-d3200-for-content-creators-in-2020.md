description: The Best Camera isn't the One You Have, It is the One You Master.

I have been a fan of storing memories digitally using my camera. I remember people holding their bulky DSLR cameras. I found them to be so cool holding a gadget like that. Acting like those professional photographers.

I remember, it was a digicam that I am using in high school (probably 2010). It won't process the picture at my first hit at the shutter, but after a few tries.. who knows? It might work. It was faulty, but it gets the job done. I used that digicam for the totality of my high school years. I always bring it everywhere: school projects, events, and random occasion where everyone gathers.

Then comes the rise of the portable phones which are almost accessible by everyone at that time. It comes with those amazing flashes, where you will look absolutely badass by hitting the shitter button. I used that together with my digicam.

There comes university (2015), when the DSLR came to my life. It is a second hand but it is still good. It was cool, I used it with our photography classes. I learned about using Manual everything, aperture, shutter speed, ISO. But that was only for picture, I have never tried it for videos before. But since I have decidede to create a Youtube channel, here I am, fidgeting my Nikon D3200.

Nikon D3200 was released on April 2012. Apparently, this camera is now at its 8 years of usage. It is still working fine, no hassles but the battery compartment where it won't lock automatically. Not that much of a hassle tho.

I am using everything that came with the kit. Camera body, lens, battery, charger, and cables. 

The first video where I tried its limits last for about 18 minutes before overheating.

It came with an EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery. It is only good for a handful of shots and videos. It will probably be enough for an entire A roll for your youtube video.
