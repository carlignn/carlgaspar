# Hi, I'm Carl Gaspar

Hi I'm Carl Gaspar and this is where I'll be writing down my thoughts and experiences in topics such as software, web development, and technology. However, fairwarning any number of other topics can pop up into this blog. I created this personal platform to learn and at the same time influence other people on what I know and I will learn in the future. This is my first attempt at a blog, and as an IT Security Admin I apologize in advance for my writing and design skills. Hopefully they will improve as I work on this more and more.

I can also be found in various services. You see... I'm @carlignn everywhere. See me at my social media accounts in the footer below.
